# Project: NYC taxi data 

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) publishes open data which contains information on all the taxi rides which have happened in the city each month. The data is available [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The [user guide](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/trip_record_user_guide.pdf) provided with the data describes in detail what is in the datasets.


## Goal and structure

The project here aims to analyze NY city economy and mobility using Cabs data as a representation. This was a group project and a significant part of this (atleast 1/4th) was contributed by me (@bktrtjbl).
