# Project: NYC taxi data 

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) publishes open data which contains information on all the taxi rides which have happened in the city each month. The data is available [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The [user guide](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/trip_record_user_guide.pdf) provided with the data describes in detail what is in the datasets.


## Goal and structure

The goal of this project is for you to present a **coherent and well-coded investigation** into some aspects of the dataset. The project here aims to analyze NY city economy and mobility using Cabs data as a representation.
